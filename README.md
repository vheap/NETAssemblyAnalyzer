# NETAssemblyAnalyzer

Reflection of .NET assemblies and extracting Imports, Exports, Functions, Strings and Embedded Resources. Obfuscated assemblies are different, but the core stays the same. Just ensure the build and assembly match Platforms (e.g. x86 for both).

Example below of a server I had once created:
